# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug: Incorrect Field Usage
This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines: using an incorrect field name within the `$group` stage.  The bug results in unexpected aggregation results or errors.

## Bug Description

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file corrects the issue by ensuring the correct field names are used in the `$group` stage.  The solution includes thorough comments and error handling to prevent such errors in the future. 

## How to reproduce
1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Start a MongoDB instance.
3.  Execute the code in `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` against your MongoDB collection to observe the incorrect and correct behaviour, respectively.
